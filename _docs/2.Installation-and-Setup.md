Or by adding the package to your `composer.json`

```json

        "arcanedev/log-viewer": "~4.0"
    }
}
```

### Setup
Once the package is installed, you can register the service provider in `config/app.php` in the `providers` array:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Arcanedev\LogViewer\LogViewerServiceProvider::class,
],
```

> No need to register the LogViewer facade, it's done automagically.

php artisan log-viewer:publish
